    "# Yield Curve Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "*Date Posted: 13 April 2025*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of fixed income the construction of the discount curve (also called zero curve) is a fundamental step in the modelling exercise. The job of an interest rate model is to describe the movements of the discount curve through time, starting from a known initial state/condition. In the Piterbarg book (see references), three main classes of curves are examined - simply bootstrapped $C^0$ curves, local splines $C^1$, and full smoothing splines $C^2$. The family of splines we will examine in this post belong to $C^2$ splines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to get agree on some notation before we dive into curve construction techniques. We say that a price of a zero-coupon bond with maturity $T$ is given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(0,T) = e^{-T\\cdot y(T)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y(T)$ is the discount (or zero) rate. We are interested in finding the curve that gives us the value of $y(t)$ for every $t$ in our domain (this can be 30, 40, 50 years, or even more in some cases). It will also be useful to build a curve of instantaneous forward rates from our yield curve. To do that we start from the following equality:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(0,T) = e^{-T\\cdot y(T)} = e^{-\\int_0^T f_u du}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is obvious that for these 2 things to be equal, the exponents need to be equal\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T\\cdot y(T) = \\int_0^T f_u du$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now take a derivative w.r.t maturity $T$ and get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(T) = y(T) + \\frac{d y(T)}{dT}T$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which tells us how the spot and forward rates are related. We can immediately see, that if we want to work with instantaneous forward curves, it will be important for our yield curve $y(t)$ to be differentiable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Local cubic splines $C^1$\n",
    "\n",
    "With a general $C^0$ bootstrapped yield curve, we end up with a piecewise linear yield curve, which results in a saw-like forward curve as the yield curve is fully differentiable. To improve on this we can build a cubic spline that will produce a smooth yield curve, but would generally not give us a smooth forward curve. Smooth forward curve is important for pricing certain interest rate derivatives to produce realistic and stable prices. To improve on that, we want to impose certain restrictions on the shape of our curves that will not only fit our data, but also produce smooth forward curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving towards $C^2$ splines\n",
    "\n",
    "We are staying in the same sphere of cubic splines, but we now want to impose the twice differentiability to the curve. Since we are still working with cubic splines, it is necessary for the second derivative to be piecewise linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Piecewise linear second derivative](imgs/piecewise_linear.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that the second derivative can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y''(x) = \\frac{x_{i+1} - x}{x_{i+1}-x_{i}}y_i'' + \\frac{x-x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}y_{i+1}''$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for all $x\\in[x_i, x_{i+1}]$. We can now integrate the expression above to find the expression for $y'(x)$. For some easier manipulation, we will denote $y_{i}''$ with $d_i$. \n",

    "## Calculating $C_1$ and $C_2$\n",

    "We already know that our second derivative is continuous (our starting assumption), and we have calculated $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that the curve will pass through the data points $y_i$. We need to ensure that also our first derivative ($y'(x)$) is continuous, and we can do so by ensuring that the value of $y'(x_i)$ defined on the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ is the same as the value of $y'(x_i)$ defined on the interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$.\n",
