# About the Author and Content

Hi, my name is Ivan and I am a double master graduate in Quantitative Finance and in Computer Science. My area of interest lays on the intersection the fields of mathematics, programming and quantitative finance.

Not only I genuinely enjoy reading/learning about interesting topics from these areas, but I also like to share interesting insights and ideas that I encounter. 

The content I share here is a way of trying to make available some things that I wish I could read, see, or hear when I was studying, or some things that I just find fascinating and I felt like sharing them.

The topics that will likely be covered are related to 

- Probability
- Stochastic Processes
- Programming
- Quantitative Finance
- anything else that I may find worth sharing🙃
